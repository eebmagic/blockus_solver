SHORT TERM:
- Get piece value at each gridpoint
    - should just be able to read at fixed intervals if picture is straight?

LONG TERM:
- Identify pieces and arrangements
    - Hard code piece arrangements, by number of squares
    - Use contour fitting on color mask?
        - https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.9/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html

- Find solution
    - Let user pick their color
    - DFS / BFS and return largest usable piece?
