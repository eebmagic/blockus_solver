SHORT TERM:
- Remove unused functions
    - general formatting and renaming

- Use KMeans labels for from_pallete instead of color_min_distance

- Identify pieces and arrangements
    - Switch to using contour fitting on color masked images?
        - https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.9/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html

LONG TERM:
- Check for invalid pieces on the board
    - Useful for checking proper image->board translation
    - If duplicate pieces of one color, then invalid board

- Either fix rotations/cropping OR just use better images?

- Find solution
    - Let user pick their color
    - DFS / BFS and return largest usable piece?
