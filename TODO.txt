SHORT TERM:
- Remove unused functions
    - general formatting and renaming

- Use KMeans labels for from_pallete instead of color_min_distance

- Identify pieces and arrangements
    - Hard code piece arrangements, by number of squares
    - Use contour fitting on color mask?
        - https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.9/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html

LONG TERM:
- either fix rotations/cropping OR just use better images?

- Find solution
    - Let user pick their color
    - DFS / BFS and return largest usable piece?
